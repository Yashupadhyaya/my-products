```
Scenario 1: Description is successfully retrieved for a product with a non-empty description

Details:
  TestName: getDescriptionWithNonEmptyValue
  Description: This test verifies that the getDescription method correctly returns the product description when it is set to a non-empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set a non-empty description using the setDescription method.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned description matches the one that was set initially.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the description retrieved by getDescription is exactly what was set, ensuring the getter method functions as expected. This is significant for displaying product details to the user.

Scenario 2: Description is successfully retrieved as null for a product without a set description

Details:
  TestName: getDescriptionWithNullValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getDescription method returns null when the description of the product has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class without setting a description.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned description is null.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the default state of the description attribute is null when not explicitly set, which is critical for understanding the initial state of a Product object.

Scenario 3: Description remains unchanged after retrieval

Details:
  TestName: getDescriptionDoesNotAlterValue
  Description: This test checks that calling getDescription does not alter the description of the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set a specific description.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the Product instance twice, capturing the results both times.
  Assert: Assert that both returned descriptions are identical.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getDescription method is non-mutating and that repeated calls have no side effects. This is important for ensuring data integrity when accessing object properties.

Scenario 4: Description is successfully retrieved for a product with an empty string description

Details:
  TestName: getDescriptionWithEmptyStringValue
  Description: This test confirms that the getDescription method can handle and return an empty string as the description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set the description to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned description is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getter method can handle empty strings, which might represent products without a description. It is significant for accurately representing the state of the product in the application.

Scenario 5: Description is consistently retrieved for multiple product instances

Details:
  TestName: getDescriptionForMultipleInstances
  Description: This test ensures that the getDescription method works consistently across multiple instances of the Product class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Product class, setting unique descriptions for each.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that each returned description matches the one set for its respective instance.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getDescription method works in isolation for each Product instance, which is crucial for maintaining object independence and correct application behavior when dealing with multiple products.

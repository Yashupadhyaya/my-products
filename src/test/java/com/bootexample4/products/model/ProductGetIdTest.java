ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getId_ba349b1eff

Scenario 1: Test default value of ID before setting

Details:
  TestName: defaultIdValueIsNull
  Description: This test checks that the default value of the ID is null before any ID is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a new Product object should have a null ID by default, which is expected because the ID has not been set. This test is significant as it validates the entity's initial state concerning its identifier.

Scenario 2: Test retrieval of ID after setting a specific value

Details:
  TestName: retrieveIdAfterSetting
  Description: This test checks that the ID returned by getId() matches the value set using setId().
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set a specific ID using setId().
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getter method for ID returns the correct value that was set, which is crucial for ensuring data integrity and the correct functioning of the entity.

Scenario 3: Test ID persistence across multiple calls

Details:
  TestName: idPersistsAcrossMultipleCalls
  Description: This test checks that the value of the ID remains consistent across multiple calls to getId().
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class, set an ID, and call getId() once.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance again.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is the same as in the previous call.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the consistency and immutability of the ID value once set. This is important to ensure that the entity's identity is stable across its lifecycle.

Scenario 4: Test ID with maximum value of Long

Details:
  TestName: idWithMaxLongValue
  Description: This test checks that the Product entity can handle the maximum value for a Long type when setting and getting the ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set the ID to Long.MAX_VALUE using setId().
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is Long.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the entity correctly handles the maximum boundary condition for its ID field. This test is significant for validating the robustness of the entity in extreme scenarios.

Scenario 5: Test ID with minimum value of Long

Details:
  TestName: idWithMinLongValue
  Description: This test checks that the Product entity can handle the minimum value for a Long type when setting and getting the ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set the ID to Long.MIN_VALUE using setId().
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is Long.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the entity correctly handles the minimum boundary condition for its ID field. This test is significant for validating the entity's behavior with negative or zero values, which may represent special cases in some systems.

These test scenarios cover the basic functionality and edge cases for the getId method of the Product entity. They ensure that the ID field behaves correctly under various conditions, which is essential for any entity that relies on a unique identifier for database operations and business logic.

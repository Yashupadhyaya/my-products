```
Scenario 1: Retrieve price when it is set to a positive value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWhenSetToPositiveValue
  Description: This test verifies that the getPrice method correctly returns the price of the product when it has been previously set to a positive value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product and use setPrice to assign a positive value to the price field.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the value set.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getPrice method accurately retrieves the price that was set. This is significant because it ensures the integrity of data retrieval for product pricing in the application.

Scenario 2: Retrieve price when it is set to zero

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWhenSetToZero
  Description: This test checks whether the getPrice method can return a price of zero, which might represent a free product or a promotional offer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Product and set its price to 0 using setPrice.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned price is 0.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the getPrice method can handle edge cases such as a product being free. It is important for scenarios where products may be given at no cost or for system promotions.

Scenario 3: Retrieve price when it has not been initialized

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWithUninitializedValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getPrice method returns the default price value when the price has not been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance without setting a price.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the new Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the default value for double data type, which is 0.0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getPrice method returns a default value when no price has been set. This is important to ensure there are no unexpected results due to uninitialized fields.

Scenario 4: Retrieve price after setting it to a negative value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWhenSetToNegativeValue
  Description: This test case checks the behavior of getPrice when the price is set to a negative value, which might not be a valid scenario for a product price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Product and set the price to a negative value using setPrice.
  Act: Invoke getPrice on the Product instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned price is the negative value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the getPrice method's behavior with negative values. It is significant because it can reveal if the system correctly handles or prevents negative pricing, which may be a business rule violation.

Scenario 5: Retrieve price with maximum double value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWithMaxDoubleValue
  Description: This test checks if the getPrice method can handle the maximum possible double value, testing the limits of the data type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its price to Double.MAX_VALUE using setPrice.
  Act: Call getPrice on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price equals Double.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice method can handle the largest possible double value. This is important for ensuring the application can deal with extreme pricing scenarios without data loss or overflow.

Scenario 6: Retrieve price with minimal positive double value

Details:
  TestName: getPriceWithMinPositiveDoubleValue
  Description: This test explores the getPrice method's capability to return the smallest positive value greater than zero that double can represent, which could be relevant for microtransactions or very low-cost items.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Product and set its price to Double.MIN_VALUE using setPrice.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned price is Double.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getPrice method can handle very small non-zero values. This is significant for applications that may require precise pricing at a very small scale.
```

Please note that these scenarios are based on the assumption that there are no business rules preventing setting negative or extreme values for the price. If such rules exist, additional tests should be created to validate those constraints.

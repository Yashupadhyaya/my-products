```
Scenario 1: Successfully delete an existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks if the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product that exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById is called with a specific id.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the id of the product to be deleted.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the delete operation returns a successful response when the product exists in the repository. This is significant as it confirms the delete functionality is working correctly for valid product deletions.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existent product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method returns a NotFound response when trying to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existent product id.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a non-existent product id.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NotFound status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the delete operation correctly handles cases where the product does not exist. This is important to ensure that the API communicates to the client that the requested resource for deletion was not found.

Scenario 3: Delete product with null id

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks how the deleteProduct method behaves when called with a null id, which is not a valid parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable since the repository should not be called with a null id.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a null id.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown due to the invalid argument.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles null id inputs gracefully, potentially throwing an IllegalArgumentException or similar. This ensures the API's robustness against invalid input.

Scenario 4: Verify repository delete call on product deletion

Details:
  TestName: verifyRepositoryDeleteCall
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method actually calls the delete method on the repository when a product is found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById is called and capture the delete method call.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid product id.
  Assert: Verify that the delete method was called on the repository with the correct product.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the repository's delete method is invoked, ensuring that the delete operation not only returns the correct response but also performs the expected action of deleting the product. This is critical for maintaining data integrity in the application.

Scenario 5: Handle database exceptions during product deletion

Details:
  TestName: handleDatabaseExceptionsOnDelete
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles any exceptions thrown by the repository during the delete operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a DataAccessException when the delete method is called.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid product id.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or handled, and an error response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the deleteProduct method is resilient to database errors and communicates issues back to the client. This is crucial for fault tolerance and proper error reporting in the application.

```
Scenario 1: Successfully delete an existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks if the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product that exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById is called with a specific id.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the id of the product to be deleted.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has an OK status.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the delete operation returns a successful response when the product exists in the repository. This is significant as it confirms the delete functionality is working correctly for valid product deletions.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existent product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method returns a NotFound response when trying to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existent product id.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a non-existent product id.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a NotFound status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the delete operation correctly handles cases where the product does not exist. This is important to ensure that the API communicates to the client that the requested resource for deletion was not found.

Scenario 3: Delete product with null id

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test checks how the deleteProduct method behaves when called with a null id, which is not a valid parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable since the repository should not be called with a null id.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a null id.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown due to the invalid argument.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles null id inputs gracefully, potentially throwing an IllegalArgumentException or similar. This ensures the API's robustness against invalid input.

Scenario 4: Verify repository delete call on product deletion

Details:
  TestName: verifyRepositoryDeleteCall
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method actually calls the delete method on the repository when a product is found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById is called and capture the delete method call.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid product id.
  Assert: Verify that the delete method was called on the repository with the correct product.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the repository's delete method is invoked, ensuring that the delete operation not only returns the correct response but also performs the expected action of deleting the product. This is critical for maintaining data integrity in the application.

Scenario 5: Handle database exceptions during product deletion

Details:
  TestName: handleDatabaseExceptionsOnDelete
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method handles any exceptions thrown by the repository during the delete operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a DataAccessException when the delete method is called.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid product id.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or handled, and an error response is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the deleteProduct method is resilient to database errors and communicates issues back to the client. This is crucial for fault tolerance and proper error reporting in the application.

/*
The unit test `deleteProductWithNullId` is expecting an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when a `null` ID is passed to the `deleteProduct` method. However, the test is failing because this exception is not being thrown as expected.

From the provided business logic in the `deleteProduct` method, we can see that it uses `productRepository.findById(id)` which likely returns an `Optional<Product>`. When `null` is passed to `findById`, it possibly returns `Optional.empty()`, which then triggers the `orElse` part of the method chain, resulting in a `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()`. This would not throw an `IllegalArgumentException`, but instead, it returns a `ResponseEntity` object with a status of `404 Not Found`.

The test failure is due to a mismatch between the expected behavior (throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`) and the actual behavior (returning a `ResponseEntity` with a `404` status). The business logic does not throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when given a `null` ID, so the test's expectation is incorrect based on the current implementation of the `deleteProduct` method.

To fix the test failure, the expectation should be aligned with the actual behavior. If the intention is to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` for a `null` ID, the business logic should be updated to include a check for `null` and throw the appropriate exception. If the current behavior is correct, then the test should be updated to expect a `404 Not Found` response instead of an exception.

    ResponseEntity<Object> response = productController.deleteProduct(null);

/*
The test `handleDatabaseExceptionsOnDelete` is failing due to an `InstantiationError` when trying to throw a `DataAccessException`. The error is occurring because `DataAccessException` is an abstract class, and you cannot directly instantiate an abstract class. The `doThrow` method in Mockito is attempting to instantiate `DataAccessException`, which leads to this error.

To correctly simulate throwing a `DataAccessException`, you need to throw a concrete subclass of `DataAccessException`. Mockito requires a concrete exception type to be thrown since abstract classes cannot be instantiated. 

The test should be modified to throw an instance of a specific exception that extends `DataAccessException`. For example, you could use `DataIntegrityViolationException`, `DuplicateKeyException`, `DataRetrievalFailureException`, or any other concrete subclass of `DataAccessException` that is appropriate for the scenario being tested.

To fix the test, you should replace `DataAccessException.class` with a specific subclass of `DataAccessException` that can be instantiated. This will allow Mockito to create an instance of the exception and throw it as expected during the test.
@Test
@Category(Categories.valid.class)
public void handleDatabaseExceptionsOnDelete() {
    doThrow(DataAccessException.class).when(productRepository).delete(any(Product.class));
    assertThrows(DataAccessException.class, () -> productController.deleteProduct(validProductId));

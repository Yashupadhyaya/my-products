/*
 * This test case has a Maven build dependency error and is not related to the test case or business logic.
 * The project is not able to resolve dependencies for `org.apache.commons:commons-io:jar:2.6` and `org.junit:junit:jar:4.13.1`.
 * To resolve this issue:
 * 1. Check your internet connection.
 * 2. Try to manually download the jars from the Maven repository and place them into your local .m2 repository.
 * 3. Delete your .m2 repository and build the project again. Maven will download all the dependencies again.

/*
  This test case has a compilation error due to unresolved dependencies. The dependencies that could not be resolved are org.apache.commons:commons-io:jar:2.6 and org.junit:junit:jar:4.13.1. 
  To fix this error, ensure that these dependencies are correctly declared in the project's pom.xml file. Also, make sure that these dependencies are available in the Maven repository from where the project is trying to fetch them.
  If the dependencies are correctly declared and still the error persists, then try deleting your .m2 folder (Maven local repository) and build the project again. Maven will download all the dependencies again and the error might get resolved.

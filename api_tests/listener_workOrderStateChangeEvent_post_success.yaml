The YAML file provided is already compliant with Artillery. However, there's a minor change to make it more robust. The `flow` section in `scenarios` has a `log` key that doesn't seem to serve any functional purpose. It's better to remove it.

Here's the corrected YAML configuration:

```yaml
config:
  target: "{{ $processEnvironment.API_HOST }}"
  plugins:
    expect: {}
  phases:
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 10
  payload:
    path: "./listener_workOrderStateChangeEvent_post_success.csv"
    fields:
      - "id"
      - "name"
      - "timeOccurred"
      - "timeZoneOccurred"
      - "lifeCycleStatus"
      - "associatedDocument"
      - "businessUnit"
      - "operationalPriority"
      - "readyForTechnicalDispatch"
    skipHeader: true
    delimiter: "^|^"
  environments:
    dev:
      target: "http://dev.example.com"
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer {{ $processEnvironment.AUTH_TOKEN }}"
    prod:
      target: "http://prod.example.com"
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer {{ $processEnvironment.AUTH_TOKEN }}"

scenarios:
  - name: "Work Order State Change Event"
    flow:
      - post:
          url: "/listener/workOrderStateChangeEvent"
          headers:
            Authorization: "Bearer {{ $processEnvironment.AUTH_TOKEN }}"
          json:
            notification:
              event:
                id: "{{ id }}"
                name: "{{ name }}"
                timeOccurred: "{{ timeOccurred }}"
                timeZoneOccurred: "{{ timeZoneOccurred }}"
              workOrder:
                id: "{{ id }}"
                lifeCycleStatus: "{{ lifeCycleStatus }}"
                associatedDocument: "{{ associatedDocument }}"
                businessUnit: "{{ businessUnit }}"
                operationalPriority: "{{ operationalPriority }}"
                readyForTechnicalDispatch: "{{ readyForTechnicalDispatch }}"
          expect:
            - statusCode: 200
            - hasProperty: "control"
            - hasProperty: "control.type"
            - hasProperty: "control.message"
            - hasProperty: "control.code"
      - think: 1
```
Please note: 
- The `log: "POST /listener/workOrderStateChangeEvent"` line was removed as it doesn't seem to serve any functional purpose.
- Always ensure that all variables used in the `json` section under `post` are available in the `fields` section under `payload`.
